In our work guiding organisations through digital-transformation journeys, we’ve witnessed a profound acceleration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) capabilities. As seasoned practitioners, we believe that 2025-26 marks a pivotal phase: from experimentation to operationalisation, from novelty to enterprise-grade deployment. Below is a structured, descriptive overview of the major trends we’re seeing in generative AI platforms, together with some data points, technical and practical perspectives, and recommendations for implementation.

1. Multimodal Generative Platforms Become the Norm
One of the clearest shifts is that generative AI platforms are no longer just generating text or simple images—they are becoming truly multimodal, able to process and generate across text, image, video, audio, code, and even structured data.

According to recent research, the GenAI landscape is being driven by “multimodal AI, advancements in ethical AI and conversational AI”.

For example, platforms are increasingly supporting video generation (see next section) and image/audio/text combinations.

In practice, as an energy-industry strategist, we see value in using these multimodal systems for scenario modelling: e.g., transforming operational logs (text), equipment images (photo), schematics (diagram) into predictive analytics and simulation results.

Technical perspective: Under the hood, this trend implies foundation models (large language models, vision-language models) with large context windows, cross-attention mechanisms for different modalities, and training on massive and diverse token sets. Emerging research forecasts an increasing number of frontier models by 2028.
Practical recommendation: Evaluate vendor platforms on their true multimodal capability (not just text). For your organisation, pilot a case where an equipment maintenance log (text) + image of the unit (photo) + sensor time-series (structured) together feed a GenAI system to produce maintenance recommendations.

2. Agentic and Autonomous AI Assistants
Beyond simply generating content, generative AI platforms are evolving into agents—capable of taking multi-step actions, integrating with external systems, and making decisions or recommendations.

An article identifies “agentic qualities” as one of the most significant trends for 2026: chatbots become assistants that act autonomously in workflows.

For example, generative AI in a SaaS product may integrate with backend APIs, trigger workflows, or proactively suggest actions rather than merely respond to a prompt.

Technical perspective: This demands orchestration frameworks, state-tracking across prompts, connection to APIs/services, and possibly reinforcement-learning or planning modules on top of foundation models.
Practical recommendation: When selecting a platform, assess whether it supports “function calling” or “action invocation” (e.g., execute a workflow). Build a minimal internal proof-of-concept where an AI agent initiates a routine maintenance workflow when sensor data crosses a threshold, generating the necessary documentation and scheduling tasks.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is a “generative AI platform”?
A generative AI platform refers to a software stack (including models, APIs, user-interfaces and integration tooling) that enables the generation of new content (text, image, video, code, audio, data) from inputs. It differs from traditional AI by its creative, generative nature rather than purely predictive or classificatory functions.

How fast is the adoption of generative AI in enterprises?
According to recent data, 78 % of organisations reported adopting AI in 2024, up from 55 % in 2023. Also, by 2026 more than 80 % of enterprises are expected to have deployed generative-AI models or APIs in production.

What are the risks of implementing generative-AI platforms?
Risks include: data bias, model hallucinations (incorrect output), copyright or intellectual-property issues, security/privacy risks (especially if models are cloud-based), cost escalation, and the potential for poor ROI if integration and process don’t align.

Which business functions are most impacted by generative-AI platforms?
Functions such as content creation (marketing, documentation), customer-service bots, code generation/automation, design and simulation, predictive maintenance (especially in asset-intensive industries), and human-machine teaming are all seeing strong impact. Integration into productivity tools (co-pilots) is also increasing.

What should organisations look for when selecting a generative-AI platform?
Key criteria include: model capabilities (multimodal input/output, reasoning, context-window size), deployment flexibility (cloud, on-premises, edge), domain-specific fine-tuning support, API/integration ecosystem, governance and audit features, security/compliance support, cost transparency, performance (latency, throughput) and vendor roadmap/updates.
