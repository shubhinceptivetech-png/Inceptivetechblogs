In today’s fast-paced development environment, AI coding assistants like Cursor have become indispensable tools. However, the key to maximizing their potential lies not just in knowing how to use them, but in understanding the best practices that transform them from simple code generators into powerful development partners.

This blog post explores real-world scenarios and best practices for using Cursor AI effectively, based on actual development experiences involving complex debugging, visual testing, and systematic problem-solving.

The Challenge: When AI Meets Real-World Complexity
Consider this scenario: You’re working on a web application with a modal that’s supposed to display as an overlay but instead opens as a full page. The calculations are incorrect, UI elements are overlapping, and critical buttons are missing. This isn’t just a simple bug fix—it’s a multi-layered problem requiring systematic analysis, visual verification, and careful implementation.

This is where most developers struggle with AI assistants. They either ask too broadly (“fix this bug”) or too narrowly (“change this line of code”), missing the systematic approach needed for complex issues.

Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development
1. Start with Context, Not Code
The Problem: Many developers jump straight into asking AI to fix specific code without providing adequate context.

The Solution: Always begin by explaining the broader context:

 “Fix this modal display issue”

 “The modal is opening as a full page instead of displaying as an overlay like it does in our other implementation. Also, the calculations are incorrect and the currency icon is overlapping with input data.”

Why This Matters: AI needs to understand the expected behavior, the current behavior, and the context of your application to provide effective solutions.

2. Use Visual Testing as Your Compass
The Problem: Developers often assume code changes work without visual verification.

The Solution: Always test changes visually, especially for UI-related issues:

– Take screenshots before and after changes

– Test user interactions (clicking, typing, scrolling)

– Verify changes across different screen sizes

– Document visual changes with screenshots

Real Example: In our debugging case, we discovered that CSS changes weren’t applying until we rebuilt the assets. Visual testing revealed this immediately, saving hours of debugging.

3. Break Down Complex Problems Systematically
The Problem: Trying to fix multiple related issues simultaneously often leads to confusion and incomplete solutions.

The Solution: Create a systematic approach:

1. Identify all related issues (modal display, calculations, UI overlap, missing buttons)

2. Prioritize by impact (user experience first, then functionality)

3. Fix one issue at a time with verification after each fix

4. Test the complete solution before moving to the next issue

FAQs
1. What is Cursor AI and how does it help developers?
Cursor AI is an AI coding assistant that provides context-aware suggestions, helps debug complex issues, and enhances productivity with visual testing and systematic analysis.

2. How can I maximize Cursor AI’s effectiveness?
Provide full context, use real data for testing, leverage AI for pattern recognition, and adopt a systematic approach to problem-solving.

3. Can Cursor AI replace human judgment?
No. AI amplifies human capabilities but does not replace human decision-making or understanding of user experience.

4. Are AI-assisted debugging tools reliable for production-level software?
Yes, if used with proper visual verification, real data testing, and systematic validation practices.

5. What are MCPs and how do they complement Cursor AI?
Microsoft Certified Professionals (MCPs) provide specialized tools like Playwright and DevTools for visual testing, automation, and code analysis, enhancing AI-assisted development workflows.
